# Challenge 1: Semantic HTML & Accessibility

## Description

For this project, I was hired by a marketing agency to refactor their website to make it more accessible. By building my client a more accessible website, they can ensure that people with disabilities can access their site using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Additionally, their site will rank higher in search engines like Google and will help them avoid litigation (which could arise if people with disabilities can't access a website).

Through this project, I was able to learn more about Semantic HTML.

## Usage

To see the changes I made to make the website more accessible, I have included the starter code in original_index.html in the repository. You can see the new code in index.html.

Below is the image of the website's landing page.
