# <challenge1-refactor-accessibility>

## Description

- What was your motivation? I was hired by a marketing agency to refactor their website to make it more accessible.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") I was hired by a marketing agency to refactor their website to make it more accessible.
- What problem does it solve? By building a more accessible website, my client can ensure that people with disabilities can access their site using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Additionally, their site rank higher in search engines like Google and will help them avoid litigation (which could arise if people with disabilities can't access a website).
- What did you learn? HTML Semantics.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## How to Contribute
